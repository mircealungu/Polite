Polite
======

We are nothing, if not polite. And sice every polite person talks in sentences, Polite is a programming language
which encourages developers to name their methdos and classes with sentences. Indeed, every method in a class 
denotes an action, which is best expressed as a sentence not as a terribly long camelcase identifier 
(which might still be preferred by the German people :)

Thus, a snippet which in a popular programming language would be written as: 

    superHero = new SuperHero('Ironman');
    superHero.beatTheHellOutOfAndSaveThe(theBadGuy, theLady)

is written in Polite like:

    super hero := Superhero, named: 'Ironman'.
    super hero, beat the hell out of: (the bad guy) and save: (the lady).
